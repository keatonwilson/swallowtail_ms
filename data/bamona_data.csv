One at the elementary school in Wyoming MN, one at O'Brien St. Park, one crossing highway 97 at Scandia  and the latest was just this afternoon in our backyard flower garden. In the 27 years that I have lived in Minnesota this is the first summer I have seen this butterfly. I know it well because I grew up in southern Indiana where it is seen somewhat frequently and still have the specimen in my old 4-H entomolgy collection and had raised them and watched them hatch. My brother is raising a small brood from a capture (a few weeks) ago at present.

We see them nearly every day, even though we spend very little time outside. In fact, my husband (Richard Hautala) who took the photo on the 13th was just outside again in the backyard a few minutes ago(7/20 at 15:45)and saw 2 more giant swallowtails flying in a tight spiraling motion around each other all over the yard, over top of house, etc. We have a lot of coneflowers in our backyard and that's what they're feeding off of (see photo which shows feeding). We are right in the middle of suburbia in the land of well-kept lawns and neatly trimmed shrubs, but we're not into that sort of thing. Our yard, while very small, is more for the critters than us (our approach is wild and low chemical). We have a very small wooded area behind the house as you can see from the map. We have a dinky dinky pond. Nonetheless, it has frogs in it and birds drink from and bath in the shallow upper pools regularly. In fact, there was a decent size hawk drinking out of it just yesterday. Out in our open are we have minimal lawn, but lots of wildflowers and vines growing freely mixed in with a few boughten plants (like the coneflowers). The center of the yard has an extremely densely covered arbor swamped in vegetation from 3 Akebia Vines. We have 5 bird feeders up and a few birdhouses around the yard also.","pinklady (16820)","","","07/23/2012 09:45:38"

It was a large yellow and black swallowtail but obviously not a tiger or black swallowtail.  I have experience seeing giants in other locations and the markings, yellow body when wings were closed and constant fluttering behavior as it was nectaring confirmed for me my initial feeling that it was a Giant Swallowtail, which was a total surprise and completely unexpected but I am totally sure of the ID.  I did try after I checked and double checked with binocs to get some photos but it was at a distance and shooting into the sun so the photos are very bad.  If you need to have a look at the pics I will send them as I think there is enough there to confirm my ID.  You will need to zoom in to enlarge it so you can see the butterfly and the markings as well as the body color, sorry the pics are so horrible but it was the best I could do shooting into sun in the evening, from a substantial distance, a long lens and with a constantly fluttering subject.  Hopefully there is enough there to verify the ID.  I know this is a rare location for this species so I am including the photos for your confirmation, not because I am proud of the pics!!!!

I caught some movement on the dwarf buddleia bushes, & caught the bold white / light yellow bar across the dorsal wings. The wing movement was constant, never stopping for a moment, as it fed from the blossoms of the shrub.

As usual, for a late-arrival butterfly, this Giant swallowtail butterfly had a damaged right, rear wing.  This butterfly  fluttered its wings continuously even when feeding, and was thus quite a challenge to photograph (by contrast, Monarch and Tiger swallowtail butterflies tend to rest with open wings whilst feeding).
In the past, I've seen a Giant swallowtail in my garden in Webster NY during July ---- e.g., on July 13th 2014, a single Giant swallowtail spent some time ""testing"" the leaves on a hibiscus potted plant and on a potted  bougainvillea plant (both indoor plants that spend the Summer outside); on July 24th 2012,  a Giant swallowtail butterfly fed on cone flowers in the front flower garden.

The summer seemed very warm and Humid but very little rain even in the mountains and deserts of southern California. Ken did you find these in orange county and San diego county in the seventies. very few records it seems back then, though there were lots of citrus farms! That seems odd but i guess since spraying is the norm not much will survive on plants. The leaf hoppers or i guess the leaf Borer moths do the most damage to our citrus in the spring and summer. The moth is very small and damages all the new growth! This is slowing down the growth of our young trees. I have read that mature trees are not bothered much by these? The leaf miners that is? Citrus Dogs Are Not a Pleasant sight to citrus farmers! ","Robert Gorman (51404)","","","12/13/2018 14:58:32"
