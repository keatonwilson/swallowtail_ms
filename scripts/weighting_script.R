#Ok, so now we need to figure out how to weight 
#The original manuscript is a little vague - but I think they set up 10 km by 10 km cells, and then count the number of occurences per cell.If a cell has a lot of occurences, it's downweighted, if only a few it's upweighted. 
#
#Can we use a distance matrix to do a similar thing with more resolution? Weight a particular value by the average distance to its closest 5 neighbors?
